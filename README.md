# React Course Practice Repo

This repository contains my hands-on exercises while learning React.  
The course is still in progress, so this repo will continue to grow with new files and projects.

## Status

- `In progress`
- Current focus: React fundamentals (`JSX`, components, props, state, effects, refs)
- More exercises and refinements will be added over time

## Tech Stack

- React (via CDN)
- ReactDOM (via CDN)
- Babel (browser transpilation)
- Day.js (used in clock exercises)
- Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Project Structure

All exercises are standalone HTML files you can run directly in a browser.

- `react-basics.html` - JSX basics and rendering
- `exercise-1.html` - JSX expressions and simple dynamic values
- `exercise -1-clock.html` - live clock using interval updates
- `exercise-2-login.html` - component extraction (`LoginForm`)
- `exercise-2-products.html` - reusable product component with props
- `exercise-3-counter-app.html` - shared state and reset behavior
- `exercise-3-display-as-you-type.html` - controlled input pattern
- `exercise-4-button.html` - toggle state (`ON/OFF`) with conditional styling
- `exercise -4-clock.html` - clock using `useEffect` cleanup
- `exercise-4-counter-app.html` - `useRef` + auto-click behavior
- `exercise-4-login.html` - password show/hide toggle with state
- `chatbot.html` - simple chat UI with async bot response handling

Assets used by exercises (images/gif) are stored in the repo root.

## How To Run

Because this repo uses CDN scripts, no package install is required.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open any `.html` file in your browser.
3. (Optional) Use a local static server or VS Code Live Server for a smoother workflow.

## Learning Goals

- Build strong React fundamentals before moving to a full tooling setup
- Practice writing reusable components
- Understand state-driven UI updates
- Get comfortable with `useEffect` and `useRef`
- Build confidence through small, focused exercises

## Notes

- This is a learning repository, so code style and patterns may evolve as the course progresses.
- Existing files may be revisited and refactored later.

## Next Planned Updates

- Add upcoming course exercises
- Improve consistency in naming and formatting
- Introduce more complete mini-project structure as concepts advance
